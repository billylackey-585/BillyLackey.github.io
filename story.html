				<h3>THE JOURNEY: STRATEGY, EXECUTION, AND A RETURN TO CRAFT</h3>
				<p>
					My career has always been driven by a fundamental question:
					<b><em>How can we use information to make better decisions?</em></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					I began my journey in the technical heart of Business Intelligence—architecting SSAS cubes,
					managing Master Data (MDM/MDS), and building complex ETL pipelines using SSIS. My early
					work focused on delivering enterprise-scale reporting through SSRS and Cognos, ensuring
					that data was not only accessible but accurate. As my career progressed, I transitioned
					into deep technical engineering and eventually into hands-on senior management roles.
					While those years in leadership sharpened my ability to drive high-level strategy,
					I found that I missed the "build"—the technical challenge of transforming raw,
					fragmented data into structured clarity.
				</p>

				<p>
					After over two decades of navigating the evolving data landscape, I made the intentional
					choice to return to my roots in BI. Today, I combine a career's worth of experience in
					data modeling and systems design with a modern analytics toolkit. I don't just build
					dashboards; I build the underlying structures that make data accurate, repeatable,
					and useful for the people who rely on it.
				</p>

				<h3>Technical Mastery & Certification</h3>
				<p>I am a <b>Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate (PL-300)</b>, a credential that
					reflects my expertise in the entire data lifecycle—from ingestion and modeling to visualization and
					deployment. My technical toolkit includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Full-Lifecycle Data Engineering:</strong> Extensive experience navigating the journey
						from source system extraction to consumer-ready delivery. I focus on the core principles of ETL
						and data movement that remain constant, whether using traditional enterprise tools or modern
						cloud-scale processing.</li>
					<li><strong>Data Modeling & Architecture:</strong> A deep background in designing robust structures,
						from Relational Star Schemas to Multi-dimensional Cubes. I prioritize data integrity and Master
						Data Management (MDM) to ensure a "single version of truth" for the business.</li>
					<li><strong>Modern BI Ecosystem:</strong> Core specialization in the Microsoft Data Stack, featuring
						a robust technical command of Power BI, Power Query, and complex DAX development.
						I focus on building sophisticated models that turn complex datasets into clear, interactive
						insights.</li>
					<li><strong>End-to-End Delivery:</strong> Beyond the technical build, I am dedicated to ensuring
						data is actually useful. This means bridging the gap between raw numbers and the intuitive
						dashboards that leaders need to make informed decisions.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>The "Growth Mindset" in Action</h3>
				<p>
					I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that while the tools always change,
					the core logic of good data stays the same. My focus is on taking everything
					I’ve learned about enterprise data over the last two decades and applying that
					knowledge to the modern data stacks we use today.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lately, I’ve been diving into the "modern" side of the house—sharpening my skills
					in Advanced DAX, Python, and the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem. For me, it’s not
					just about learning a new interface; it’s about ensuring that as we move into
					AI-driven analytics, the underlying data remains accurate, reliable, and
					actually useful for the people making the decisions.
				</p>

				<h3>Beyond the Data</h3>
				<p>
					I’ve always believed that the same curiosity that keeps me exploring
					modern data toolsets is what drives me to keep growing personally. I’m
					constantly looking for ways to apply what I’ve learned over the last two
					decades to the new technologies hitting the market today, ensuring I
					can always provide clarity in a fast-moving industry.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I’m not focused on data, my life is centered around my family.
					You’ll usually find us at a game or a competition—whether it’s
					watching my son play college baseball or supporting my daughter at
					a high school cheer event. My wife also keeps us grounded through
					her work with a local non-profit that provides essential housing and
					support for abused women and children. For me, staying sharp professionally
					is about more than just the tech; it’s about being a reliable partner
					for my family and the organizations I serve.
